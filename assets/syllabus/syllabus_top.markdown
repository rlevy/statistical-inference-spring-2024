## Readings & Textbooks

Readings will frequently be drawn from the following textbooks:

1. Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin.  Speech and Language Processing.   Draft chapters for the third edition can be found [here](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). (I refer to this book as "SLP3" in the syllabus.)

   This textbook is the single most comprehensive and up-to-date introduction available to the field of computational linguistics.  *Note:* we will also be using some chapters from the second edition (2008); these will be referred to as J&M2008 on the syllabus, and will be available on Canvas.

2. Jacob Eisenstein.  2019. Introduction to Natural Language Processing.  MIT Press.  Pre-publication PDF available [here](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes-10-15-2018.pdf).

    This is an excellent more recent textbook on natural language processing, with contemporary deep learning thoroughly integrated.  We will be using the pre-publication version freely available, under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-ND license, [here](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes-10-15-2018.pdf).

3. Bird, Steven, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper.  2009. [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Python-Steven/dp/0596516495).  O'Reilly Media. (I refer to this book as "NLTK" in the syllabus.)

   This is the book for the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) (or NLTK), which we may be using for programming.  We will also be doing some of our programming in the Python programming language, and will make quite a bit of use of Python.  You can buy this book, or you can freely access it on the Web at [http://www.nltk.org/book](http://www.nltk.org/book).

4. Emily Bender. 2013. Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing: 100 Essentials from Morphology and Syntax. Springer. If you are authenticated using your MIT credentials you can download this book in PDF format [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-02150-3).

5. Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze. 1999. Foundations of statistical natural language processing. Cambridge: MIT press.  Book chapter PDFs can be obtained through the MIT library website. (I refer to this book as "M&S" in the syllabus.)

   This is an older but still very useful book on natural language processing (NLP).

We'll also frequently draw on other sources for readings, including original research papers in computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and other areas of the cognitive science of language.
