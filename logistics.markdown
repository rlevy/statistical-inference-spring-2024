## Class organization

The in-class content for this course will consist of lectures, interactive discussions, and practice with software that implements the techniques covered in class

## Requirements & grading

You'll be graded on:


|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Work                                                                                                                         | Grade percentage (9.19) |
| A number of homework assignments throughout the semester                                                                     |                     75% |
| A class project                                                                                                              |                     25% |

Active participation in the class is also encouraged and taken into account in borderline grade cases.

### Collaboration policy

We strongly encourage you to study, work together, and collaborate with classmates. This includes reviewing and discussing readings, pre-recorded lectures, and in-class exercises, discussing homework assignments (psets), and studying to prepare for exams. However, you must write up each homework assignment on your own.  Additionally, please list the people you have discussed the pset with at the top of your assignment.

Class projects are fully collaborative and write-ups should be done jointly. 

### Policy on use of generative AI

Generative AI refers to tools that can generate media such as text, code, images, video, and sound, generally in response to inputs such as textual prompts or queries. In our view, using generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) as part of creative and intellectual processes is becoming an important skill in contemporary society. I encourage you in general to use generative AI tools for the work in this course in whatever ways you believe best assist your learning and growth.  (We the instructors are using these tools for the same purposes!) Remember though that **these tools cannot be trusted to reliably provide accurate content.** You are ultimately responsible for your own understanding of the material we cover, and for demonstrating that understanding.

Please do share your experiences using generative AI to help learn and understand class related material. It's very helpful to hear about your experiences!

Since the generative AI landscape is changing so rapidly, this policy
is subject to change mid-semester. If we change it, we'll announce the
change.


### Submitting assignments

Please submit your psets and course projects via Canvas. For each pset submission, attach each submission file individually---please do *not* zip them together into a single bulk file as it creates additional grading work.

### Pset late policy

Psets can be turned in up to 7 days late; 10% of your score will be deducted for each 24 hours of lateness (rounded up, so e.g. you lose 10% of your score for an assignment turned in 12 hours late).  For example, if a homework assignment is worth 80 points, you turn it in 3 days late, and earn a 70 before lateness is taken into account, your score will be (1-0.3)*70=49.



### Mapping of class score to letter grade

It can be hard to perfectly predict the difficulty of assignments and exams.  Therefore I determine standards for end-of-semester letter grades in light of student performance throughout the class (though I do not grade on a curve).  However, I guarantee minimum grades on the basis of the following thresholds:

|-----------+--------------------------|
| Threshold | Guaranteed minimum grade |
| >=90%     | A-                       |
| >=80%     | B-                       |
| >=70%     | C-                       |
| >=60%     | D                        |

So, for example, an overall score of 90.0001% of points guarantees you an A-, but you could well wind up with a higher grade depending on the ultimate grade thresholds determined at the end of the semester.

### Regrade requests

Instructors can make mistakes like everyone else, and I want to make sure you get the points and the grade you deserve. The statute of limitations is that **all regrade requests must be made within two weeks of the instructors returning graded work to the class.** This is to keep things manageable on the instructor's end. Thank you!
