## Well-being and flexibility in teaching during COVID

The 9.19 instructional staff acknowledge that we're teaching in an extraordinary time, and that there are many sources of uncertainty and fatigue. We are committed to providing you a supportive, stable, and safe educational environment during this time. In addition to the pre-recorded that we're working with, live class sessions will be recorded and made available afterwards.

If you are notified that you must isolate or quarantine because of a COVID-related issue â€“ please know that we are committed to working with S3 or GradSupport to support your continued learning this semester. we understand how difficult these times are and we will all need to remain flexible and adjust to the situation. The details of what may be required will vary depending on the timing and duration of your absence.  Please feel free to reach out to us at any point if you have any questions or concerns.
