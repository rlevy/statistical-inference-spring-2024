## Class Description

  As the empirical domain of brain & cognitive sciences research continues to grow, the data used for scientific inference have become more diverse and complex. These data often require complex analytic techniques not extensively covered in core introductory classes, and the skill to use these techniques appropriately in practice to yield scientifically valid inferences and insights. This course in the second half of spring 2024 builds on a foundational understanding and practical competence in concepts in probabilistic and statistical inference to be obtained inthe first half of the semester by covering key analytic techniques including causal inference, hierarchical/multilevel regression, and high-dimensional/multivariate methods. I place special emphasis on conceptual understanding of statistical techniques and on ensuring alignment between one's scientific questions and how statistical models are formulated and used in data analysis.


## Class organization

Class sessions will include a combination of lecture, interactive discussion, review, and practicum sessions.

## Intended Audience

Class content will be of interest for students, postdocs, faculty, and researchers in brain & cognitive sciences, psychology, linguistics, and potentially for sister disciplines including computer science, political science, sociology, economics, and other social science fields. Content covered in the first half of 9.073, or equivalent, is a prerequisite.

## Readings & Textbooks

The readings list will be developed over the course of the semester, and will draw on a variety of readings from multiple fields. There is no ready-made textbook customized to the content we'll be covering, so keep in mind that different readings may vary in the terminology, notation, and framing used for the same fundamental concepts. I also endeavor to provide written lecture notes throughout the semester.

## Software

We will be using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical computing language, as well as its interface to the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) probabilistic programming language, in the class. R is extremely powerful and expressive out of the box, and its extraordinary collection of [community-contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/) makes it even more so. In particular I will use packages in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) extensively, especially for data handling and visualizations, without spending a lot of time teaching them directly. If you don't have much previous experience with R, there are many tutorials and other self-study resources available; I recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). The [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) integrated development environment (IDE) is popular and free; I will use it for the class, though you don't have to.
